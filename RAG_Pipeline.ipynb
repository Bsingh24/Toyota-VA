The airbag is not deployed, and the brake pedal is depressed, \\n while the engine is running. Other indicators of the fault include \\n the intermittent radio, which may not be on, and the engine's ability to run at normal \\n speed. If the accelerator pedal is depressed while the engine is \\n running, the accelerator will stop the engine, and the engine may \\n continue to run at a reduced speed until the vehicle is shut off. The \\n motor will begin to run again, but the fuel pressure may decrease. If you have questions about \\nthe transmission, contact your dealer.\\nThe following questions are specifically designed to address technical problems that could \\nbe encountered when using the Toyota features listed above   \n",

Make sure that the disc is at the same  or less  temperature as the  discs. This  may  be achieved by checking the  top edge of the  disc. If the top edge  is hot and disc is not hot enough, you may need to  proceed with the replacement  of the disc. Answer:  If your brake pads are in the middle of their life, you should replace them only if the  temperature of the disc is  temperature warmer than the  temperature of the pad, which is an  average temperature.  If the temperature is  not above the average, replace the disc.  If the temperature is above the average, replace the pad.   \n",
